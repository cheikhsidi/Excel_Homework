If you’re considering using Kickstarter to fund your next big idea, you need to be armed with data so you’re not going about it blindly.
with the given Kikstarter Dataset using Excel analytics tools we could summaraise the three folowing founding:


1-	One of the outstanding conclusions we can make from the analysis is that the funding success rate is disproportional with the project goal amount, 
the smaller project goal the more likely to get funded and the opposite.
 
2-	We can also conclude that there is a high success rate in the Music Category and moderately in Theater, 
and Film & video categories, which mean if the project in these categories are more likely to get funded. 
while the Food and games have the highest failure rate, which are not likely to get funded.


3-	In the sub-category we can notice high pick number of projects in plays sub-category with moderate success. 
And a complete success rate in Rock music, documentaries, and hardware, all the projects falling in these sub-categories were all funded successfully.
 
The main limitations are that the dataset is incomplete very limited sample and have some missing data.
 
We could create another table for the subcategories, to calculate the percentage per sub-categories, 
and we could also make a graph from the results to compare the success rate vs failure pers sub-category.
